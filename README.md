# Movie Database

This demo loads a MySQL database and presents it into a user-friendly interface. Users can select 
movies, directors, and genres to load different views, as well as search for keywords. As you 
search and navigate, you can click to display the associated SQL queries for review.
The database is normalized to minimize redundancies and expedite data retrieval.

## Notes:

The server code is located in /server/index.js. The final version incorporated into my
portfolio also includes code to allow it to work with https and the security certificate
supplied by my hosting platform.

Some other modifications were necessary to incorporate this demo into the online portfolio,
but this code is nearly identical to the deployed version. You can see these modifications
by finding my full portfolio repository here on GitHub.
